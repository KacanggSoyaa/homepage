            On my first semester , my "Penasihat Akademik (PA)" gave a link for
            club enrollment. The club name is
            <em class="ClubName">Kelab Teknologi Digital</em> which is the main
            club under my course department. Without wasting more time, I filled
            my name in the enrolment link and after that I successfully joined.
            This is how my journey started in the
            <em class="ClubName">Kelab Teknologi Digital</em>. On the first
            semester i was joined a few program that have been organized by the
            club. I was assigned to be AJK Multimmedia on the Multimedia Biro.

            On my Second semester , I was still active in the
            <em class="ClubName">Kelab Teknologi Digital</em> and I also still
            the AJK Multimedia on the Multimedia Biro. I was assigned to be the
            AJK Multimedia for the second time. Not gonna lie I was so happy to
            be the AJK Multimedia again because I can learn more about
            multimedia and also can improve my skills in multimedia. Not just
            that I've improved my communication skills after joining the club,
            Before this I was a shy person and not really good at communicating
            with people. But after joining the club, I can talk to people more
            confidently and fluently. Second semester was the big changes in my
            diploma life because I was given a lot of task and responsibilities.
            I also got a chance to joined one of the outside program that have
            been organized by
            <em class="ClubName">Malaysia Digital Economy Corporation (MDEC)</em
            >. 2 representative of
            <em class="ClubName">Kelab Teknologi Digital</em> was chosen to
            joined the program and I was one of them. A lot of representative of
            other clubs from the different polytechnic and university was there
            and I was so excited to meet them. The program was held for 1 days
            at Cyberjaya. I learned a lot of things from the program and also
            met with a lot of new friends. I was so grateful to be one of the
            representative of
            <em class="ClubName">Kelab Teknologi Digital</em> to joined the
            program.

            On my Third semester , I was appointed to be the
            <em class="ClubName">Vice President of Kelab Teknologi Digital</em>.
            I was so happy to be the Vice President because I can learn more
            about leadership and also can improve my skills in leadership. This
            semester is quite challenging because I need to handle a lot of
            programs and also need to manage my time well for focusing on
            studying. I also need to make sure that all the programs that have
            been planned can be executed successfully. Actually my semester 2
            final exam result was not very good because of my busy schedule with
            the club programs. But I learned from my mistakes and I will not
            repeat the same mistakes again. I will make sure that I can balance
            my time between club activities and studies. And guess what, I did
            it! I managed to get a good result for my semester 3 final exam. I
            was so happy and grateful for that. This is the proof that
